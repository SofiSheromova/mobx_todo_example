# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Use `dart fix` for apply automated fixes to Dart source code.
# To use the tool, run either 'dart fix --dry-run' for a preview of the proposed changes for a project,
# or 'dart fix --apply' to apply the changes.

  # producing the lint.
